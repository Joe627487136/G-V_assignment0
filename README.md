## Answers for the Questions ##
1. Did you collaborate with anyone in the class?
> I collaborate with Guanlun Zhao in the class and we both work seperately but only share insight over the mouse control in bonus section

2. Were there any references (books, papers, websites, etc.) that you found particularly helpful for completing your assignment?
> glutimer: https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/552318-what-is-the-use-of-the-value-parameter-in-gluttimerfunc/
> how to implement rotation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3515059/how-to-rotate-a-specific-object-in-opengl

3. Are there any known problems with your code? 
> Although the camera view roatation has been implemented, but if we do try to rotate then the light spot is also rotating. Maybe beacuse the lighting is currently attached to my object and I do my code as I rotate the object so it happens. 

4. Did you do any extra credit? 
> State as above. Camera, rotation, fading transition are all applied.

5. Got any comments about this assignment that you'd like to share?
> Accept the mac version and the linux one. It's brutal to let us use VS and with such a old version. I was so mad when I brought my main.cpp which ran well in xcode to the VS 2010 since many operators were not even working in the old version. If you do hope us to use VS and do C++, then I guess accept a higher version VS project is better I guess. I want to use "auto" for "for each". I'm lazy. Thank you!
